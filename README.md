const logPath = "/path/to/your/log/directory"
const needConsoleLog = true/false (true by default)
const debugLevel = "full"/"anonymous"/"minimum" ("minimum by default")

module.exports = loggingMiddleware(logPath, debugLevel, needConsoleLog)
```

- Require logger in your index.js file

```
const loggingMiddleware = require('../middleware/logging.middleware')
